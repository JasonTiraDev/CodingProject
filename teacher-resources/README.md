## 📖 Teaching Strategies

### Recommended Approach
1. **Demo First**: Show working example before explaining code
2. **Incremental Building**: Add one feature at a time
3. **Pair Programming**: Encourage collaboration
4. **Regular Testing**: Run code frequently to catch errors early
5. **Creative Freedom**: Allow students to customize and experiment

### Common Challenges & Solutions

#### Technical Issues
- **Problem**: Code doesn't run
- **Solution**: Check for typos, missing semicolons, bracket matching

- **Problem**: Unexpected behavior
- **Solution**: Use console.log() to debug, step through logic

- **Problem**: Performance issues  
- **Solution**: Optimize loops, limit particle counts

#### Engagement Issues
- **Problem**: Students finish early
- **Solution**: Provide extension challenges, encourage helping others

- **Problem**: Students fall behind
- **Solution**: Pair with advanced students, focus on core concepts

## 🎮 Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment
