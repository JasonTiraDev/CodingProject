- Code organization and structure

## 🎯 What You'll Build
- Multiple weapon types (single, spread, orbital)
- Power-up collection system
- Level progression with increasing difficulty
- Experience points and upgrades
- Polished UI with progress bars and banners
- Complete survival game with all features

## 🎮 How to Run
1. Open [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
2. Copy and paste the code from `game.js`
3. Click the Play button
4. Survive as long as you can and collect power-ups!

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered
- **Complex Systems**: Multiple interacting game mechanics
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Games that get harder over time
- **Weapon Systems**: Different player abilities and upgrades
- **Trigonometry**: Using math for circular motion (orbital weapons)
- **Game Balance**: Making games fun and challenging
- **State Management**: Complex game state tracking

## 🎮 Weapon Types
- **Single Shot**: Classic pew-pew laser

- **Orbital**: 3 spinning shields that destroy enemies

## 💡 Try These Modifications
- Add new weapon types with unique behaviors
- Create different enemy types with special abilities
- Adjust the level progression speed
- Change power-up spawn rates
- Modify orbital weapon behavior

## ❓ Discussion Questions
1. How does the progressive difficulty system work?
2. What makes the orbital weapon different from bullets?
3. How could you add a new weapon type?
4. What would happen if enemies got smarter AI?
5. How could you balance the game to be more/less challenging?

## 🎯 Advanced Challenges
- Add boss enemies that appear every 5 levels
- Create a shop system where XP can be spent on upgrades
- Add different enemy types with unique behaviors
- Implement a save/load system for high scores
- Add particle effects for explosions and impacts
- Create multiple levels/arenas with different layouts
