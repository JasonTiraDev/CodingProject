# 🎮 Day 1: Your First Game!

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today (in 1 hour!)
- How games work (they redraw the screen 60 times per second!)
- How to make things move on screen
- How to control a character with keyboard keys
- How computers think about positions (X and Y coordinates)
- How to display text and colors

## 🎯 What You'll Build
By the end of today, you'll have:
- A cyan (blue-green) circle that YOU can control!
- Arrow key OR WASD controls (like in real games!)  
- A start screen with your own custom title
- A character that can't escape off the screen
- Your very first working video game!

## 🎮 How to Get Started

### For Students:
1. **You'll be typing the actual code!** - The file has guides but you fill in the details
2. Open the `starter.js` file - this has TODO items for you to complete
3. **The HINTS show you exactly what to type** - but you have to type it yourself!
4. Follow the STEP-BY-STEP comments and complete each TODO
5. **Test after each step!** Run your code to see what changes
6. Try the "TRY THIS" suggestions - they're fun modifications!
7. Don't worry if you make mistakes - that's how you learn!

### Quick Start:
1. Go to [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
2. Copy your code from `starter.js` into the editor
3. Click the Play button ▶️ to see your game!
4. Use arrow keys or WASD to move around

### For Teachers

- **Students type all the actual code** - `starter.js` has TODOs with detailed HINTS
- **Perfect balance of challenge and support** - They know what to type but must type it
- **`completed.js` shows the finished result** - Use for demonstrations and troubleshooting
- **Each TODO can be completed independently** - Students can work at their own pace
- **HINTS provide exact code** - But they still get the satisfaction of typing it
- **Built-in modifications** - "TRY THIS" sections for students who finish early

## 🔑 What They're Actually Learning (Even If They Don't Know It)

- **Variables** - Like labeled boxes that hold information
- **Functions** - Recipes that the computer follows  
- **Coordinates** - How to tell the computer WHERE to put things
- **Events** - How to make the computer react to keyboard presses
- **Logic** - Using IF statements to make decisions
- **The Game Loop** - Why games feel alive and responsive

## 💡 Easy Modifications to Try

**Colors** (change the numbers in `fill()`):
- `fill(255, 0, 0)` = Red
- `fill(0, 255, 0)` = Green  
- `fill(255, 0, 255)` = Purple
- `fill(255, 255, 0)` = Yellow

**Size & Speed**:
- Make `player.size` bigger (30) or smaller (10)
- Make `player.speed` faster (8) or slower (2)
- Change canvas size: `createCanvas(1000, 700)`

**Text**:
- Change the game title to their name
- Add their own instructions

## 🗣️ Great Questions to Ask Students

1. **"What happens if we make the speed really big, like 50?"**
2. **"Can you make the player red instead of cyan?"**  
3. **"What if we made the game window really tiny?"**
4. **"Why do you think the background gets redrawn every time?"**

## ➡️ Tomorrow We'll Add

- **Enemies** that chase the player around
- **Collision detection** (when things bump into each other)
- **A score system** to make it feel like a real game
- **Game over** when enemies catch you!
