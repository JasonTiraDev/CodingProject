# 🎯 BONUS DAYS RESTRUCTURING TODO

## 📋 Overview
Apply the same educational pattern from Days 1-3 to the bonus days 4-6:
- **starter.js** = Previous day's completed code + current day's TODOs only
- **completed.js** = All working features for the current day
- **README.md** = Updated to reflect proper progression and file structure

## 🔧 Pattern Requirements

### Educational Progression Pattern:
1. **Day 4 starter.js** = Day 3 completed code + Day 4 visual TODOs
2. **Day 5 starter.js** = Day 4 completed code + Day 5 audio TODOs  
3. **Day 6 starter.js** = Day 5 completed code + Day 6 advanced TODOs

### File Structure Standards:
- Comprehensive TODO/HINT comment system for student guidance
- Clear section markers and step-by-step instructions
- No working implementations in starter files (TODOs only)
- All features fully implemented in completed files
